## Setup

This project requires Python 3.6+ and recommends using a virtual environment.

To set up a virtual environment and install dependencies, you can use the tasks defined in Visual Studio Code:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

2. Go to the `Terminal` menu and select `Run Task`.

3. Select the `Create and activate virtual environment` task. This will create a virtual environment named `listenv` and activate it.

4. Once the first task is complete, go to the `Terminal` menu again, select `Run Task`, and then select the `Install requirements` task. This will install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

Please note that these tasks will only affect the terminal where they are run. To use the virtual environment in other terminals or in the Python interpreter used by Visual Studio Code, you'll need to select it as your Python interpreter.
